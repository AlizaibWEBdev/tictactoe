How to Play
The rules of Tic Tac Toe are simple: each player takes turns placing their symbol (either X or O) on the board until one player gets three in a row or all spaces are filled. The first player to get three in a row wins the game!

To start a new game, simply click the "New Game" button in the top right corner of the screen. Then, take turns placing your moves on the board by clicking on the desired square. The game will automatically switch between X's and O's until one player wins or the game is tied.
